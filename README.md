## Getting Started
Looking for an expierenced gym buddy ?  You have come to the right place. First you want to use the easy Navigation bar located at the top of the page to direct yourself to Create User. After creation youll notice a page dedicated to all the users who have signed up. Here you can see location and picture. Feel free to browse all the gyms by location. Remember these are set up in a **Zipcode** manner. Do you not see your gym ? then feel free to create one, each of the boxes provided will allow you to add all the necessary information so that others can see it too.
